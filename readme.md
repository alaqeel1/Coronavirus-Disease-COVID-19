# Problem Statment
    

The Coronavirus **(COVID-19)** has infected more than two million people so far worldwide, with many cities and countries being under lockdown.

Governments response to manage this crisis varied worldwide, Understanding the number of cases  invaluable information for governments and people alike. 


At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for **(COVID-19)**. but i will show you how the data scientist help the world to fight **(COVID-19)** .


In the this project understanding the  total cases **Worldwide** in each country and focus on **Gulf** countries cases and **Saudi Arabia** country.


And try to find the effects between the number of **Populations** and **(COVID-19)** cases ,and how does number of **populations** influence and effects of disease outbreaks **(COVID-19)**.


**I hope to answer the following questions by the end of the project:**

- Which countries have the highest number of Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered cases ?
- What is the duration for countries to contain the outbreak ?
- What is the growth for Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered cases overtime ?
- Which day have the highest number of Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered cases ?
- How does number of **Populations** influence the effects of disease outbreaks ?

In the end applying many modeling to predicting the new **Worldwide** cases and new cases in **Saudi Arabia**.

# Observations
 
 
 
- An early the Coronavirus (COVID-19) start spread only in China and  neighboring countries.
- Then the Coronavirus (COVID-19) quickly spread to Europe, US, and other countries.
- In Europe the Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in 5 March.
- Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the US, UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France are still outbreak,  in high spreadit
- Coronavirus (COVID-19) In Saudi Arabia,start spreading on 3 March, and now the number of confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia around 5,000 cases.
- The Saudi government implemented quarantines, closed the airports and all markets, the virus slowed spreading but Coronavirus (COVID-19) did not stop spreading. 
- Now the number of confirmed cases in World Wide around 2 million cases, and 90% of cases are from Europe and US



# Conclusion
    
    
    
 - At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for (COVID-19).
 - When countries implemented quarantines the Coronavirus (COVID-19) slow down of spreading.
 - When closed the airports and all markets,  and people stay at home the Coronavirus (COVID-19) slow down of spreading
 - High probability are Coronavirus (COVID-19) will continue and the number of cases will increase.



# Next steps ( Future work) :


- I will complete update this project until the of the end of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019)

- Trying to find subjects that effects to outbreaks corona disease **(COVID-19)**

    **like:**
      - Weather temp.
      - Tourist in Countries.
      - Size of Countries

- Compare some of the sectors affected by the corona disease **(COVID-19)**

     **like:**
       - Stock market.
       - business market.
       - Countries economy.
 
- Collect more data of corona disease **(COVID-19)** , and collect the cases in all citites of **Saudi Arabia.**
 
 
    
# Challenges

- you know the number of cases increased every minutes, so should be this data are updated every day.

- don't have a lot of data in my region about the corona disease (COVID-19) cases in Saudi Arabia Cities, so i'm using the official dashboard from Ministry of Health  (MOH).
